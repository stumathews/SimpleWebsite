This page contains the basic files that represent individual pages in your website.
Pages are suffixed with .page extensions and are xml files which represent the content and of a web page:

<page>
	<title>Page Title</title>
	<content>
		Content goes in here
	</content>
</page>

Pages that are designated for errors are suffixed as .error files which contain the same structure as .page files.

Dropping .page files in this folder will populate the website dynamically.
